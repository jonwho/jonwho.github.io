    <h2 class="md-title"><strong>Hi I'm Jon!</strong></h2>
    <p class="big">
      I'm a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California San Diego. I have 3 years professional experience in both industry and start ups. Currently I enjoy making web applications in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, MEAN stack, or simply client-side work in vanilla JavaScript or AngularJS. Besides web applications I am an experienced software engineer using Java and hobbyist game maker using Unity.

    <h2 class="md-title"><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
    <p class="big">
      I love playing video games! Ever since I could power on my Super Nintendo on my own I've been locking myself in my room playing all sorts of goodies. Most memorable games to me will always be Super Mario and Donkey Kong. I had such great scores for a 6 year old! I'm also crazy about sports. I follow Basketball and Tennis as well as eSports! I used to play tennis against the wall because it was the only opponent who didn't get tired before me (haha?). I played junior varsity basketball and varsity tennis while in high school and I think that the competitiveness I gained from each sport is what I value the most. I think it's what made me the engineer I am today.

      I also love bad jokes! Like really really terrible ones! Quick, did you have steak for dinner last night? No? Some would call that a miss-steak! That one's free, you're welcome world.
