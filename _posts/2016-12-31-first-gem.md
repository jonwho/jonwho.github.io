Completed my first gem! It's called [Lolxin](https://github.com/jonwho/lolxin)
and it's not very smartly done at all. But it's still super neat. It is an API
wrapper around the League of Legends API. There's no tests and no sense of
documentation so there's still plenty left to work on. However I painstakingly
tested it by hand and each call works when given the correct input.

Pretty good start before the new year I would say minus the whole not getting
my year end goals completed.
