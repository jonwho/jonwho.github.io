			A typing application made for those afflicted by Locked-in Syndrome (LS). This application uses the 
			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us">Microsoft Surface</a> and 
			<a href="https://theeyetribe.com/">EyeTribe</a> technology to enable typing using only your eyes.
			The traditional method for communicating with a LS patient is to use an alphabet chart and wait for
			the patient to blink on letters when a care taker crosses the correct letter. This method does not
			allow for a patient to initiate conversation. With the use of Speedy Type a patient can initiate
			conversation and convey needs or simply thoughts. Our method proved to be faster than the traditional
			method and with my team (UC SpeedyDragons) we made features like piano play and article writing possible.
			To learn more about Speedy Type and its application read our research paper <a href="../res/projects/speedydragons/SpeedyType.pdf">here</a> and watch our demo video.

			Playable game on Xbox or PC! Written in C# using XNA framework 3.0 this game makes use of the 2D environment made by stitching together sprite sheets. Gameplay is similar to that of Zelda for free
			world movement. But the battles are handled like Final Fantasy! Handled using turn-based system with
			attacks like slaps and coffee bombs! This was a fun project made with a team of 5 and we covered
			everything from graphics, save states, to audio playbacks. Learned a great deal about software development with a team and an ever growing respect for game developers ever since. I take you 8-bit
			games for granted no more! Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/jonwho/ScottTheIntern">here</a>.
