    <p class="big">
      I'm currently contracted as a student programmer for the University of California, San Diego. My work is focused on porting a Flash game which has research
      applications to the Android platform, specifically for the tablet space. This game focuses on teaching young children suffering from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders how to use meta-cognitive techniques to reduce disruptive behavior. I work closely with another student programmer as we report to doctors
      from both UCSD School of Medicine and Emory School of Medicine. Development of the game is done through Unity which lets us compile for many of the
      popular platforms such as the web, Android, iOS, and PC.

    <p class="big">
      Working at Sony deepened my knowledge about web application testing and scaling. I ran continuous integration tests and spent time reviewing tests written in Cucumber covering the network platform. While at Sony I was given a solo project that allowed me to engage 1 on 1 with a client integration engineer to meet tooling needs. I created an internal web application using AngularJS to mitigate the redundancy involved for a client integration engineer to do their daily tasks.

    <p class="big">
      Being a web developer in a start up company was an enlightening experience. The amount of work you do is really dependent on yourself and I it helped me gauge what was possible when I poured time into a project. My duties as a web developer was to make a web portal in Ruby on Rails to support remote administrator access to client resources. Building this application from the ground up was a hard but rewarding task and I learned more about best engineering practices from mistakes than I did success at school.

    <p class="big">
      I worked for this company while it was still called Life Technologies. At that time I was part of a team that more closely resembled a start up environment. It was a new team building an application to integrate lab data straight to the web. I ran tests on our usage of Amazon Web Services. Ranging from a simple EC2 instance quality check, DynamoDB data assurance, S3 qualifying queries, and helping other interns with their tasks. I also worked as part of an intern sub-team that changed how employees used the IT help desk so that it was more intuitive to use and garnered better results.
