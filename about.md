Welcome to my site! I'm Jon and I made a blog to ramble on about nothing.
You can find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/jonwho) doing random projects.

Everyday my goal is to cure my boredom. My cures vary from video games like
League of Legends to CS:GO and programming projects. I think it's vital to be
curious and JavaScript standards change everyday so it's hard to stay bored
for too long.
