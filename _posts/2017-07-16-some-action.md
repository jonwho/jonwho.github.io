Got bored and wanted to try out some Rails ActionCable. Made this little app
that lets you watch one of my favorite study beats video on YouTube while
having a live chat window open. All in all it wasn't difficult to setup
ActionCable and having an easy WebSocket interface through Rails could mean
plenty more possibilities.

Try it out [here](https://jonwho-streamup.herokuapp.com/) !!
