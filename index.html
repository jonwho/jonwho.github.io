							<h2>Computer Science?</h2>
							<p>At first it was because I was undecided. I was a junior in high school yet I had no idea what I wanted to do for a living. I bounced around the idea of being a pharamcist or dentist. But those careers never really appealed to me like CS did. I was simply on the computer most of the time and everyone has that family member that they would ask for computer help, and that person was me! I mean I was good at it because I always tinkered with my computers. 
							<br />
							<br />
							I never really thought about CS being a career until I watched a lecture given by Randy Pausch called "The Last Lecture". And what really hit me wasn't that he was a CS professor, but what he left behind was something significant. He changed the lives of his students and colleagues alike. And I wanted that kind of success. I wanted the success that comes with being great at your field of work. As soon as I wrote my first C program
							in high school, it really sunk in that this is my career, a career that impact the daily interactions of people I'll never meet. It is meaningful and enduring.</p>

							<h2>Hackathon</h2>
							<p>I placed 2nd place in a challenge called Code Golf for programmers using C. The challenge was to implement the Leibniz Sum with the shortest amount of characters (whitespace & special characters included!).
							<br />
							<br />
								 This challenge made me look back at all the knowledge of C I had, the little quirks about it when it comes to expressions, functions and headers. Ultimately I put my code into 1 line and used a ternary op to cut out
								 if-else condition and that shortened the code by a lot. I made sure to cut out all extra variables and reuse only 2 variables to loop and keep track of the Leibniz Sum.
							<br /> 
							<br />
								 In the end I was only behind the next C developer
								 by .2 points. Which is something along the lines of 2 characters! So close yet so far.
							</p>
						</div><!--/span-->
						<div class="span4">
							<h2>Sports</h2>
							<p>I play a lot of sports inlucding basketball, tennis, table tennis, badminton, chess, checkers, and LoL (I consider it a sport!). I think what these all have in common is that I love competition. Skill sets can be refined
								 and visually you can see your own improvements; be it jumpshot, backhand wing, or intellect, these components come into play against one another. To me mean winning means you developed a skill set that raises the level of play of not only yourself but amongst others as well. Competition drives success, and I love competition.
