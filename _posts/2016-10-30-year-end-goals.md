I think it's important to list goals for yourself. I find myself constantly
reflecting on my past year and it's difficult to gauge just how much I've grown
as an engineer. Even now as I'm writing this I see that my writing and prose
just sucks; it's a happy-sad moment when you realize how long you've been out
of college (what are essays? what are deadlines? pfft). There's much to improve
on but namely I want to focus on my growth as an engineer. So here's a quick
short list of things I hope to learn and become more proficient in before
2016 is over.

* Node.js
* Golang
* Angular2 + TypeScript shennanigans
